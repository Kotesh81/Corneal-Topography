# Corneal-Topography
Synopsis: A mobile based application  for mapping the surface curvature of the cornea, the outer structure of the eye.
Code Details: This application is designed to take patient details as input and capture multiple images which are stored in a database.
The details as well as the images are accessible through DB browser for SQLite.
Entering incorrect details would lead the app to crash
Also while taking images, the order of button clicks is callibrate->capture->save. If this order is not followed the app crashes again
However, if you want to discard the captured image don't click on save.
For recapturing callibrate again before capturing
